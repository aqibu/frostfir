Frostfir is a small, experimental site focused on learning through building.

It serves as a public notebook for testing ideas, documenting technical setups,
and exploring lightweight, privacy-conscious ways of publishing on the web.

There is no roadmap, no growth goal, and no tracking beyond what is required
to operate the site securely.
