Frostfir is an experimental website and a simple demonstration of how you can host a modern, fast website for free using Cloudflare Pages, with the only recurring cost being the yearly domain registration. There’s no server to manage, no hosting bill to worry about, and no complex infrastructure — just a static site that gets built and deployed automatically.

This approach also has some nice privacy and security benefits. A static site has a much smaller attack surface than a traditional dynamic website, and using a platform like Cloudflare removes the need to expose or maintain your own servers. The setup behind Frostfir is intentionally straightforward and easy to emulate, whether for personal use or for a small business that wants something reliable without unnecessary complexity.

Frostfir will live somewhere between a public experiment log and a personal hub — a place to showcase my social media work while also keeping written notes and blog posts alongside it. The goal isn’t polish or perfection, but to document what I’m trying and to show that building something simple, affordable, and reasonably privacy-respecting is accessible to pretty much anyone.
