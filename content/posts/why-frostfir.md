Frostfir is an experiment.

I wanted a simple, durable way to publish content on the web without turning it
into a product, a platform, or a surveillance surface.

This site is built using Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare Pages, which makes it
possible to run a fast, globally distributed website for free. The only
recurring cost is the domain itself.

What makes this setup interesting is not just the cost, but the tradeoffs.
Static sites dramatically reduce complexity, attack surface, and dependency on
third-party services. There’s no database, no login system, and nothing to track
users across the web.

This setup is easy to replicate. Anyone can build something similar for personal
use, documentation, or even a lightweight business presence without committing
to ongoing hosting fees or invasive analytics.

Frostfir will serve as a public notebook — a mix of experiments, short write-ups,
and notes about things I’m testing or learning. Some posts may be technical,
others more conceptual, but all of them are written with simplicity and
intentionality in mind.
